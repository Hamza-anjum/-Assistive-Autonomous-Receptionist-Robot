# -Assistive-Autonomous-Receptionist-Robot
An open-source autonomous robot system designed to serve as an assistive receptionist, capable of greeting visitors, providing guidance, and enhancing accessibility in various environments. This project combines computer vision, natural language processing, and autonomous navigation to create a welcoming and efficient robotic assistant.
‚ú® Features

    Autonomous Guest Greeting: Identifies and welcomes visitors using computer vision and sensor fusion

    Intelligent Guidance: Navigates and leads guests to their destinations with optimal path planning

    Multi-modal Interaction: Supports voice, touch, and gesture-based interactions for accessibility

    Real-time Monitoring: Continuous environment assessment for safe and efficient operation

    Customizable Interface: Adaptable to different institutional needs and branding requirements

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

    ROS 2 (Robotic Operating System) for core functionality

    Python and C++ for primary programming languages

    OpenCV and TensorFlow for computer vision tasks

    GPT-based models for natural language interactions
